# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Chart.js Setup and Usage

### Installation

1. **Using npm:**

   ```bash
   npm install chart.js
   ```

2. **Using CDN:**

   Add the following script tag to your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
   ```

### Basic Setup

1. **HTML Structure:**

   Create a `<canvas>` element in your HTML where the chart will be rendered:

   ```html
   <canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
   ```

2. **JavaScript Initialization:**

   Initialize Chart.js by adding the following JavaScript code:

   ```javascript
   // Import Chart.js if using modules
   // import Chart from 'chart.js';

   // Get the context of the canvas element we want to use
   var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');

   // Create a new Chart instance
   var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
       type: 'bar', // Specify the type of chart (e.g., 'bar', 'line', 'pie')
       data: {
           labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
           datasets: [{
               label: '# of Votes',
               data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3, 7],
               backgroundColor: [
                   'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                   'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                   'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                   'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                   'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                   'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)',
                   'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)'
               ],
               borderColor: [
                   'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                   'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                   'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                   'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                   'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                   'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)',
                   'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)'
               ],
               borderWidth: 1
           }]
       },
       options: {
           scales: {
               y: {
                   beginAtZero: true
               }
           }
       }
   });
   ```

### Customization

- **Update Data:**
  Change the `data` property within the `datasets` array.

- **Modify Appearance:**
  Customize colors, borders, and other visual aspects in the `datasets` object and `options` property.
